# WebScraping

This webscraping program can scrape multiple websites by just plugging in the link and skimming through the HTML.

I used a steel manufactures website as a reference but have other things such as scraping for GPU prices on newegg.

Output will be to a CSV file and depending on how you code the output can vary.
